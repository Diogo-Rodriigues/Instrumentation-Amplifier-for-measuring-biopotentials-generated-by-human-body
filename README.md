# Instrumentation-Amplifier-for-measuring-biopotentials-generated-by-human-body
This practical work aims to study the acquisition and amplification of differential signals using an instrumentation amplifier. The focus is on measuring biopotentials generated by the human body, such as EMG (electromyogram), EOG (electro-oculogram), EEG (electroencephalogram) and ECG (electrocardiogram).
