# Instrumentation Amplifier for measuring biopotentials generated by human body
### Important Note ⚠️ : Keep in mind that this is an informal report just to demonstrate what I learned and was able to accomplish with this work! The report is explained in English but all the notes, calculations, diagrams, etc. were made in the notebook in Portuguese!

**Summary:**

- This practical work aims to study the acquisition and amplification of differential signals using an instrumentation amplifier. The focus is on measuring biopotentials generated by the human body, such as EMG (electromyogram), EOG (electro-oculogram), EEG (electroencephalogram) and ECG (electrocardiogram).
- The practical experiment will focus on ECG measurement as it is one of the easiest signals to observe. For this, three electrodes will be used: two to capture the differential signal from the heart and one as a reference. The instrumentation amplifier will be responsible for amplifying and filtering the signal before processing.
